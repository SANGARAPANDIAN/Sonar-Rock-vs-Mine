"This is a machine learning model designed to predict whether the signal received from the sonar corresponds to a rock or a mine. The model utilizes a logistic regression algorithm and requires the following libraries: pandas, numpy, and sklearn.

To import the necessary modules, use the following commands:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score"
